# Battleship Game Refactoring Documentation

## Summary
This project underwent a significant transformation from a monolithic JavaScript implementation to a well-structured Ruby application. The refactoring focused on improving code organization, maintainability, and testability while transitioning to Ruby's object-oriented paradigms.

## Core Changes

### 1. Architecture
- Moved from a single JavaScript file to a structured Ruby application
- Implemented Domain-Driven Design principles
- Separated concerns into distinct layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure)
- Introduced proper object-oriented design patterns

### 2. Language Transition
- Converted from JavaScript to Ruby
- Adopted Ruby's coding conventions and best practices
- Implemented Ruby's testing framework
- Utilized Ruby's object-oriented features

### 3. Code Quality
- Improved code organization and structure
- Enhanced error handling and validation
- Added comprehensive test coverage
- Reduced code complexity and improved maintainability

### 4. Features
- Enhanced CPU strategy implementation
- Improved game flow management
- Better user interface and feedback
- More robust game state handling

### 5. Benefits
- More maintainable and extensible codebase
- Better testability and reliability
- Clearer separation of concerns
- Improved code reusability
