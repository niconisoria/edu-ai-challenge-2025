Got it! Let’s break down your requirements carefully:

**Requirements:**

* Social platform with millions of users
* Need to store profiles, posts, and user connections
* High read speed (80% reads, 20% writes)
* Scalability (handle growth gracefully)
* No hybrid solutions (single database solution only)

---

### Step 1: Initial Shortlist of Database Candidates

1. **Cassandra**

   * Justification: Highly scalable NoSQL database designed for massive write and read throughput. It handles huge datasets well, with good horizontal scalability. Optimized for fast writes and decent read speed. Widely used in social-type applications.

2. **MongoDB**

   * Justification: Document-oriented NoSQL DB that supports flexible schemas (great for profiles/posts). Has secondary indexes and good query capabilities. Scales horizontally via sharding. Good read speed, although write scalability is somewhat less than Cassandra.

3. **Neo4j**

   * Justification: A graph database designed specifically for managing complex relationships such as user connections. Excels in queries involving relationships and traversals. Good read speed on graph queries but may struggle with very large datasets unless properly scaled.

4. **PostgreSQL**

   * Justification: Powerful relational DB with strong ACID guarantees. Supports complex queries and indexing. Can scale vertically well and horizontally with extensions (though not as naturally scalable as NoSQL). Good read speed with indexing and caching.

5. **Amazon DynamoDB**

   * Justification: Managed, highly scalable NoSQL key-value and document database. Designed for high availability and low latency at scale. Offers seamless scaling and consistent read/write throughput. Suitable for social app workloads.

### Step 3: Final Selection - Stepwise Elimination

* **Eliminate PostgreSQL:**
  Although strong on complex queries and mature, it can struggle with horizontal scalability for millions of users and massive growth. Handling huge connections (friends/followers) with joins can become a bottleneck at scale.

* **Eliminate Neo4j:**
  While excellent for connections and relationship queries, it is less ideal for handling large volumes of posts and profiles with high read/write throughput at social network scale. Scaling graph databases for millions of users is complex and costly.

* **Eliminate MongoDB:**
  Great flexible schema and decent scalability, but for social platforms with extremely high read speed needs and large-scale data, its performance and scalability is not as robust as Cassandra or DynamoDB, especially on write-heavy workloads.

* **Remaining Candidates:** Cassandra vs DynamoDB

---

### Final Choice: **Amazon DynamoDB**

**Reasons:**

* Seamless and automatic horizontal scaling to millions of users and beyond, no manual sharding needed.
* Extremely low latency read and write, optimized for high throughput.
* Supports flexible data models (key-value + document) which can handle profiles, posts, and connections efficiently.
* Built for 80% read, 20% write workloads with consistent performance.
* Fully managed, reducing operational overhead.
* Widely proven in production for large social and gaming platforms.

**Cassandra is a strong candidate but requires more manual management, tuning, and operational complexity compared to DynamoDB’s fully managed service. DynamoDB better satisfies the no-hybrid, scalable, high-read, and ease-of-use criteria together.**

### **Summary:**

| Step              | Reason                                                            | Result          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Remove PostgreSQL | Poor horizontal scalability for massive social graphs             | Eliminated      |
| Remove Neo4j      | Complex scaling, expensive at large scale                         | Eliminated      |
| Remove MongoDB    | Less robust scalability and performance at large scale            | Eliminated      |
| Choose DynamoDB   | Best mix of scalability, read speed, flexibility, managed service | Final Selection |
